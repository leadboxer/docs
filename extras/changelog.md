# Changelog

## 19-12-2022

This week so far, we fixed an issue with links to LinkedIn not working properly in some cases on the account details panel and actually link to the homepage of an organization if we know it.&#x20;

## 15-12-2022

We added the option to manually create a Card on the LeadBoard, straight from from the Leads view. That sounds complicated but it is not really, just have a look at this screenshot and hopefully it wil make sense:

## New Integration: Active Campaign

We are happy to announce the latest native integration with Marketing Automation and CRM software Active Campaign.&#x20;

You can see the complete details of the integration [here](../integrations/other/active-campaign.md)



### 30-11-2022

## New Enrichment Engine

We enabled our new enrichment Engine based on domain-names for all accounts. Meaning all new leads and contacts that have either an email or domain-name will be enriched using our new Engine.&#x20;

The New engine is our new 'state-of-the-art' API based endpoint. We will release this endpoint to the public in 2023.

### Lead Details & UI improvements

As you may have noticed, many of the new features we have added are based on a new User Interface library with modern design patterns that we are transitioning to.&#x20;

We now have added a new Lead Details View or drill-down, and we are also pleased to announce that we have added animations!&#x20;

To see them in action, go to your LeadBoard and click on one of your cards, and open an associated lead.&#x20;

### Bug-fixes and small improvements&#x20;

* Improvements to the LeadBoard, including a new 'empty state' screen. So that if you have no LeadBoards, it becomes clear what you can do with this feature.
* Style and content updates for the 'Account details panel', for example we now show the email address for each lead if this is known to LeadBoxer
* Style and content updates for the 'Lead details panel', where we now show first campaign and other UTM tag values.&#x20;



## 14-22-2022

### Workflow automation

We have added a new feature called Workflow Automation, that will allow you to create all sorts of simple or complex tasks.

For example to tag a lead if they visit a certain page.

A complete overview tutorials can be found here:&#x20;

* Improved initial importing speed of leads into the Leadboard.
