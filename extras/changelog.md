# Changelog

## 30-11-2022

### New Enrichment Engine

We enabled our new enrichment Engine based on domain-names for all accounts. Meaning all new leads and contacts that have either an email or domain-name will be enriched using our new Engine.&#x20;

The New engine is our new 'state-of-the-art' API based endpoint. We will release this endpoint to the public in 2023.

### Lead Details & UI improvements

As you may have noticed, many of the new features we have added are based on a new User Interface library with modern design patterns that we are transitioning to.&#x20;

We now have added a new Lead Details View or drill-down, and we are also pleased to announce that we have added animations!&#x20;

To see them in action, go to your LeadBoard and click on one of your cards, and open an associated lead.&#x20;

### Bug-fixes and small improvements&#x20;

* Improvements to the LeadBoard, including a new 'empty state' screen. So that if you have no LeadBoards, it becomes clear what you can do with this feature.
* Style and content updates for the 'Account details panel', for example we now show the email address for each lead if this is known to LeadBoxer
* Style and content updates for the 'Lead details panel', where we now show first campaign and other UTM tag values.&#x20;
