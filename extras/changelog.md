### Bug-fixes and small improvements&#x20;

* Improvements to the LeadBoard, including a new 'empty state' screen. So that if you have no LeadBoards, it becomes clear what you can do with this feature.
* Style and content updates for the 'Account details panel', for example we now show the email address for each lead if this is known to LeadBoxer
* Style and content updates for the 'Lead details panel', where we now show first campaign and other UTM tag values.&#x20;
