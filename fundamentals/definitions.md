# Definitions

### What are Leads?

There are many different definitions of leads in this world, and we think it does not really matter how anyone defines it as long they keep their definition clear and fixed within their organisation and throughout the marketing and sales workflow.

There are also many subsets of Leads such as Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL), Sales Qualified Leads (SQL), BAND leads, hot leads, etc.

### Our definition of a Lead

{% hint style="success" %}
In LeadBoxer, we have defined **Leads** quite broadly as any <mark style="color:orange;">**Individual**</mark> that shows or has shown any interest in your product or service AND is Identifiable as either an (anonymous) employee of a company or as a know contact.
{% endhint %}

### What are Accounts

In LeadBoxer, we define companies and organizations as <mark style="color:purple;">**Accounts**</mark>. Accounts contain one or more leads. In other words:

{% hint style="success" %}
**An account is a grouped 'view' of leads from the same organization.**
{% endhint %}

### Behaviour tracking

By using various tracking technologies and connecting with your other marketing tools, we can (among other things) track individual leads when they browse your site and read your emails. MeaningLeadBoxer can track all the (digital) interactions or engagement your leads have with your content or organization, and store this as their 'behaviour'. This behaviour can be found for each Lead as part of their LeadProfile&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Individual behavioural visualisation is also know as a click-stream, event-stream, actions, etc.
{% endhint %}

The behaviour gives insight into their interests, buyer journey, marketing phase, and also provides input to build up a rich Lead Profile, for example by [tagging](elements/lead-tags.md) based on pages they visit.

Behaviour can also be crucial in your [**Lead Qualification**](../solutions/lead-qualification.md) process to either qualify or disqualify a lead.

### Channel

A channel is a marketing term that refers to the source of traffic to a website or a specific page within a website. Common channels include organic search, social media, email marketing, and paid advertising. See [Tracking Marketing campaign data](../integrations/website/tracking-marketing-campaign-data-utm-tags.md#channels) for more details.

### Clickstream

A clickstream, or click path, is a list of all the pages viewed by a visitor, presented in the order the pages were viewed, also defined as the ’succession of mouse clicks’ that each visitor makes through a website.

### Organization name

We identify the organization name for some larger corporate and educational networks using the IP address.\
A list of the organizations from which visitors accessed your site. These are mostly large organisations which service their own networks. A lot of educational networks fall into this category.

### Country / Region / City

We determine an Internet visitor’s location based on their IP address.\
And show a drill-down list of countries, regions, and cities which your visitors come from.

### Event

Event; pageview, click, launch.\
Any activity that takes place on an Internet-connected device can be defined as an event. This web-service securely tracks, monitors, and generate real-time analytical reports for any device connected to the Internet.\
WAA Definition: Any logged or recorded action that has a specific date and time assigned to it by either the browser or server.

### Exit links

An exit link is a link from your site (domain) to another site (technically a 3rd party domain). An exit link is a link leaving your site to a third-party site. Imagine a bridge from your site to another site. Exit links begin on your site and lead to the other side of the bridge.

### Geo-location

Geolocation is the identification of the real-world geographic location of an object, such as a mobile phone or an Internet-connected computer.\
We determine an Internet visitor’s location based on their IP address and /or GPS coordinates.

### Last event

Last recorded event or click made by a visitor on a site. Either a click on an exit link, or the 7

last page visited if no exit activity is measured.

### Number of visits

The total number of distinct visits made to a site over a given period of time. A visit starts with an entry click and ends with an exit event or a 10 minute period of inactivity. Every visitor can make an unlimited number of visits.

### Pageview

A single web page viewed by a human through a browser is a pageview. Technically: a file, or a combination of files, sent to a visitor as a result of that visitor’s request being received by a server.

### Referrer

Third party website or source (i.e. search engine, link, banner, email) through which a visitor reaches your site. Search engines are the primary example, but other sites with links leading to your site are also referrers. Some examples are forums, banners, links, directories, portals, shops, homepages, etc. Newsletters and Email are also be referrers. If a person clicks on a link from an email to your site this is captured if they are using an online mail client.

### s.e. = single event (visit)

A “single event” or “Single page view” visit is defined when a visitor clicks on a single page of your site, and no second click or exit event recorded.\
WAA Definition: Visits that consist of one page-view.\
Single-Page Visits: Visits that consist of one page regardless of the number of times the page was viewed.

### Session

Session, visit.\
A visit or session by a visitor or user. A visit or session to a website, or a session on a mobile application. Visits and sessions end when a) there are no further clicks on the website or b) the app is paused or closed.

### Visit

A visit begins when a visitors enters your site with an entry click and views a succession of one or more pages. Each page requested and viewed is a pageview. The end of a visit is signaled by an exit click or a 10 minute period of inactivity. The next event (click) will be a new visit.

WAA Definition: A visit is an interaction, by an individual, with a website consisting of one or more requests for an analyst-definable unit of content (i.e. “page view”). If an individual has not taken another action (typically additional page views) on the site within a specified time period, the visit session will terminate.

### Visitor
