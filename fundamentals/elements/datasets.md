# Datasets

### What is a dataset?&#x20;

A dataset is anything that you want to measure. In the past we referred to datasets as sites, but the definition has changed to include a broader definition. \
Now, a dataset can be a  single page, subset of pages, campaign landing page, sub-domain, app. etc. Think Internet of Things.&#x20;



### Measure all your websites

Some organisations have more than one website, LeadBoxer allows you to add multiple sites to your account, for example a specific product, region, language or event.

For a detailed tutorial to add a site see [here](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/19-how-to-add-a-dataset-website-to-your-account)

Simply add them to your account in the [dataset overview](https://app.leadboxer.com/datasets) and you will receive a unique lead pixel to install on these domains.

We also offer cross-domain tracking, please contact us for details and pricing.
