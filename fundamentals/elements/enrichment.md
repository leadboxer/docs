## What is Enrichment

In LeadBoxer, the process of adding information to a lead or account is called Enrichment.

By default, if you only install the tracking pixel on your website, we will start measuring your visitors and capture some basic information. It is the various Enrichment engines and connectors we use to turns this data into something that is valuable.

We support 2 different kinds enrichment:

This is the thing that really moves the needle.

## Common mistakes or misconceptions

### Can i get contact details from anonymous visitors?

Here is an example of a question we frequently receive:

Q: I have an account with LeadBoxer, but I can't see the individual people's details like name of the person and email address who are just visiting on our website, is there any way to get that information?

A: No. Individual names and email addresses not available by default because of how the internet is built, you remain anonymous until **you** make yourself known. Convincing your visitor to give you this information a part of the Lead generation process.&#x20;
