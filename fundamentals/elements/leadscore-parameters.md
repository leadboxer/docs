### Leadscore

[Lead Scoring](https://www.leadboxer.com/solutions/online-lead-generation/automatic-lead-scoring/) is a power concept finding its way to the top of everyoneâ€™s mind that is in the Lead Generation space. Now that you are collecting data, its time to set your personal, automatically calculated Leadscore.
