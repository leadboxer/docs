If you need to filter based on a large number of accounts, clients, former clients, or target accounts, then the List feature might be what you need.

The LeadBoxer Lists feature allows you to:&#x20;

1. Upload a list of company names and / or domain names.&#x20;
2. Apply this list as a Filter and make part of your Segments (and notifications)
