#### **Daily / Weekly Notifications**

Once you have created a Segment you can send it to yourself and/or your colleagues. This is a very powerful tool - you will be informed (in real-time) when a specific activity occurs or you can receive an e-mail with the top-ranked leads every day/week; also in the format of your choosing, Excel (.csv) or html (email) or PDF

The alerts can be **very specific** -  a particular company for account-based-marketing; client viewing the pricing page, or **very broad** - a region, all identified companies, or multiple alerts for different industries.&#x20;

This feature is very intuitive and dynamic. The only limit on how to use it is your imagination.
