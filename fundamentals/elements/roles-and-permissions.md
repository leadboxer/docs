# Roles & Permissions

Introduction: In LeadBoxer, we have implemented a robust roles and permissions system to help you manage user access and control within your organization. This guide will provide an overview of the four fixed roles available - Owner, Admin, Super User, and User - as well as instructions on creating custom roles and customizing permissions.

## Fixed Roles:&#x20;

### Owner:

* The Owner role is the highest level of access and has full control over the entire organization's settings, data, and user management.
* Only one user can be assigned the Owner role, and this user is typically the individual who initially created the organization's account.
* The Owner can add, modify, or remove users, assign roles, customize permissions, and manage billing information.

### Admin:

* The Admin role is designed for users who require significant control and management capabilities within the organization.
* Admins can add, modify, or remove users, assign roles, customize permissions, and access most settings.
* However, they do not have the same level of access as the Owner and cannot modify billing information.

### Super User:

* The Super User role is suitable for users who need access to advanced features and data but do not require administrative privileges.
* Super Users can perform most actions within the application, such as creating and managing users and add or manage datasets.
* However, they cannot add or remove users, assign roles, or modify permissions.

### User:

* The User role is the most basic level of access and is intended for individuals who primarily consume content and use the application's features without requiring administrative or advanced capabilities.
* Users can view, interact with, and contribute to the application's content based on their assigned permissions.
* They cannot modify settings, add or remove users, or access sensitive data.

## Custom Roles and Permissions:

* In addition to the fixed roles, LeadBoxer allows you to create custom roles and tailor permissions according to your organization's specific needs.
* To create a custom role, navigate to the "Roles & Permissions" section in the application's settings.
* Click on "Create Custom Role" and provide a name for the role.
* After creating the custom role, you can customize the permissions by enabling or disabling specific actions or access rights.
* You can assign the custom role to individual users from the Users overview page as needed.



## How to set a Role for a User:

* To manage roles and permissions for users, navigate to the "User settings" page&#x20;
* Find the user you wish to modify, and click the options icon to assign or change their role.
* If you have created custom roles, those will also be available for selection.
* Make sure to review and update permissions regularly to ensure users have the appropriate level of access based on their responsibilities.

Conclusion: Effectively managing roles and permissions in LeadBoxer allows you to maintain control, security, and productivity within your organization. By utilizing fixed roles and customizing permissions, you can tailor user access to match specific job requirements.
