# Segments



### What is a segment?

In Leadboxer, you can save any combination of filters into a so-called ‘segment’. Segments allow you to save one or multiple filters and access it at any time. You can save segments, edit or duplicate them, or even send emails containing your segments or share them with colleagues.

Your leadboard contains a default segment: ‘Top leads’. This segment filters out all leads without a known company name - easily allowing you to filter out the unidentified companies.

**Using the Property Filters you can create Segments.**&#x20;

Segments have several functions:&#x20;

* As a saved combination of filters which you can select from the Segment drop-down menu.
* Share your combination of filters with team-members/ colleagues.
* As a start point for notifications - see this [article on setting up (email) alerts](notifications.md).
