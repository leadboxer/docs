### Ownership

We added the Lead ownership concept in LeadBoxer a few years ago, but it somehow got snowed under by new features and other cool stuff. So last month we decided it was time to revamp the concept and make it part of our core feature set again.

Lead Ownership is also saved as a value in the Lead Properties, meaning that:

* Lead Ownership can also be used in the filters; using an easy select drop-down of your users.
* Lead Ownership is visible in the Lead Card as a separate item (including the timestamp on hover)
* Lead Owner can be selected in the custom column drop-down in the Leads overview.
