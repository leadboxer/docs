# Workflow Automation

At LeadBoxer we don't like repetitive tasks and aims to make things as easy as possible for you, For that reason we added the Workflow Automation section.

### What is Workflow Automation

Use the Workflow Automation section create all kinds of (business) logic or rules to automate simple and complex tasks. This will allow you to implement the logic of your desired workflow to be executed by LeadBoxer.

### Examples

The most simple example is to tag a  webvisitor if they visit a certain page.

eg, tag a webvisitor as <mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">job-seeker</mark> if the visited the /jobs.html page
