# Leadscore

Our technology is NoSQL which means no tables. We mention this to explain that we need a way of ordering all the leads. Either chronologically by time, or by Leadscore. We do this on-the-fly, which means every time you open a report we (re)calculate all leads based on a scoring algorithm. \
\
This powerful tool means that we show you the most qualified and interesting leads at the top of the list.&#x20;



### Set your Leadscore

Lead Scoring is a powerful concept making its way to the top of everyone’s mind in the Lead Generation space. Now that you are collecting data, it’s time to set custom, automatically calculated lead scoring.

Once you start using LeadBoxer, you'll notice that every lead has a Leadscore. By default, your leads are sorted based on a standard Leadscore setting. Now is the time to give it your personal touch. If you are unsure how to start, you can select one of our predefined settings, and adjust them based on your needs. To do this, just go to the leadscore page.
