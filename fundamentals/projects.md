# Leads & Accounts

## The main page of LeadBoxer

When you login, you will open the **Leads & Accounts** page. This page /screen / report / view is the command centre and beating heart of LeadBoxer.&#x20;

You will see an overview of all your Leads and Accounts. You can apply filters, create segments, import, export data, hide, remove, group, merge and many other operational tasks.&#x20;

It is also the place for research, and to drill-down in your data and locate opportunities or other pieces of information you were not aware of.&#x20;

Below, you will find a complete overview of the page and links to all the relevant sections, definitions and elements.

### What is the Leads & Accounts page?

In a nutshell: a list displaying all your Leads; which can also be grouped into Accounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
For an explanation of [Leads](definitions-and-glossary.md#what-are-leads) and [Accounts](definitions-and-glossary.md#what-are-accounts), please read our [definitions](definitions-and-glossary.md).
{% endhint %}

The Leads and/or Accounts are rendered in a table or grid which can be customized to show or hide additional columns. You can choose from a wide range of properties or behavioural fields. You can customize the columns by clicking on the column icon and  choose to show/ hide. you can also search for specific columns.

### Summary Columns

In order to provide a snapshot of each lead without horizontal scrolling, we created a Summary Column in 3 versions: Small, Medium, Large.

* **Small** contains only the name of the organization and the name or email of the Lead.
* **Medium** adds the lead tags and LeadBoards the Lead or Account is on.
* **Large** adds Employee count, Industry, Revenue and last activity.

### Column sets

By default we show a selection of columns, but we encourage you to create your own and save them as a 'column set'.

You can save your prefered view as a column set to quickly find your preferred set of columns.

The Column set selector also provides the option to select the [LinkedIn Matched Audiences](elements/import-and-export/linkedin-matched-audiences-export.md) column sets for both Leads (contacts) and Accounts (Companies).

### Lead Details Drawer

If you click on any lead, this will open the Lead Details Drawer. The drawer contains numerous details about the individual lead on i) profile information, ii) individual behaviour and iii) the option to drill-down to associated organization.
