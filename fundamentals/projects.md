# Leads & Accounts

### What are Leads

There are many different definitions of leads in this world, and we think it does not really matter how anyone defines it as long they keep their definition clear and fixed within their organisation and throughout the marketing and sales workflow.

There are also many subsets of Leads such as Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL), Sales Qualified Leads (SQL), BAND leads, hot leads, etc.

### Our definition of a Lead

{% hint style="success" %}
In LeadBoxer, we have defined **Leads** quite broadly as any <mark style="color:orange;">**Individual**</mark> that shows or has shown any interest in our product or service AND is Identifiable as either an (anonymous) employee of a company or as a know contact.
{% endhint %}

### What are Accounts

In LeadBoxer, we define companies and organizations as <mark style="color:purple;">**Accounts**</mark>. Accounts contain one or more leads. In other words:

{% hint style="success" %}
**An account is a grouped 'view' of leads from the same organization.**
{% endhint %}

### Behaviour tracking

By using various tracking technologies and connecting with your other marketing tools, we can (among other things) track individual leads when they browse your site and read your emails. MeaningLeadBoxer can track all the (digital) interactions or engagement your leads have with your content or organization, and store this as their 'behaviour'. This behaviour can be found for each Lead as part of their LeadProfile&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Individual behavioural visualisation is also know as a click-stream, event-stream, actions, etc.
{% endhint %}

The behaviour gives insight into their interests, buyer journey, marketing phase, and also provides input to build up a rich Lead Profile, for example by [tagging](elements/lead-tags.md) based on pages they visit.

Behaviour can also be crucial in your [**Lead Qualification**](../solutions/lead-qualification.md) process to either qualify or disqualify a lead.

### Lead Profile

Digital footprints and online (or offline) behaviour allow us to build up Lead Profiles.

### Acquisition

In LeadBoxer we primarily focus on Leads that are acquired through some digital channel, although it is quite common to have leads that came in through a trade show, event, showroom, etc. It is important that you keep track of your acquisition channel as it will give you many insights later down the road into what are the best channels to invest in.
