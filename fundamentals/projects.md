# Leads

### What are Leads

There are many different definitions of leads in this world, and we think it does not really matter how anyone defines it as long they keep their definition clear and fixed within their organisation and throughout the marketing and sales workflow.

There are also many subsets of Leads such as Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL), Sales Qualified Leads (SQL), BAND leads, hot leads, etc.

### Our definition of a Lead

{% hint style="info" %}
In LeadBoxer, we have defined **Leads** quite broadly as any <mark style="color:orange;">**Individual**</mark> that shows or has shown any interest in our product or service AND is Identifiable as either an (anonymous) employee of a company or as a know contact.
{% endhint %}

### Accounts

In LeadBoxer, we define companies and organizations as [<mark style="color:purple;">**Accounts**</mark>](projects.md#undefined). Accounts contain one or more leads. In other words, **an account is a grouped 'view' of leads from the same organization.**

### Behaviour

As Leads are individuals operating their browsers and email clients, we can track them as they interact with your content or organization, and this allows us to all the digital actions that each lead does and store this as their behaviour. &#x20;

The behaviour gives insight into their interests, buyer journey phase, and provides input to build up a Lead Profile.&#x20;

Behaviour can also be crucial to qualify or disqualify a lead.

### Lead Profile

Their digital footprint and online (or offline) behaviour allows us to build up a Lead Profile.

### Acquisition

In LeadBoxer we primarily focus on Leads that are acquired through some digital channel, although it is quite common to have leads that came in through a trade show, event, showroom, etc. It is important that you keep track of your acquisition channel as it will give you many insights later down the road into what are the best channels to invest in.
