# LeadBoard

The LeadBoard is a kanban-style overview of your Leads & Accounts, where you can qualify, annotate, investigate, and manage your leads. It allows you to keep track of your most important Leads and their journey towards Sales opportunities and eventually new customers.

## Getting started

If you arrive at the LeadBoard for the first time, you get asked to create your first LeadBoard.

To create a LeadBoard, you click on the 'Create LeadBoard' button and follow these 3 steps to complete:

1. Create LeadBoard
2. Define Stages
3. Import Data

* Provide a name for your LeadBoard. We recommend a short and descriptive name, so that all users understand what the goal of the board is. eg. Demo signups, LinkedIn campaign leads, EU Leads, etc.
* Select the Dataset / site.&#x20;
* Select the [Segment](task-lists.md) from which the matched leads will be automatically imported in this LeadBoard.
* Set the visibility of this LeadBoard to be visible to only you or anyone that has access to this dataset.
