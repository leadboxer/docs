# Advanced Outlook Add-in

_LeadBoxer has 3 different Outlook plugins:_

1. [_The Official add-in_](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/148-outlook-365-outlook-for-mac-outlook-in-browser)
2. _The Advanced add-in_
3. _The Legacy plug-in_&#x20;

**This page is documentation for the Advanced Outlook add-in**

The Advanced add-in is identical to the [Official add-in](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/148-outlook-365-outlook-for-mac-outlook-in-browser), AND replaces the need to activate the tracking for each email with an auto-enable option.&#x20;

To Install the Advanced version, first make sure you do not have the Official version installed.&#x20;

**For individual install**

1. Go to the add-ins section in your outlook![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/565e1cb7c697915b26a5c214/images/60c1d23e96768369c70bc5a5/file-PATOS1rlbk.png)
2. Click on the **My add-ins** tab and scroll down to Custom Add-ins
3. Click on **Add custom Add-in** and select **Add from URL**
4. paste URL: [**https://subscription.leadboxer.com/LeadboxerOutlookWebPlugin.xml**](https://subscription.leadboxer.com/LeadboxerOutlookWebPlugin.xml) and click ok

This should install the advanced add-in. You can use the instructions from the official add-in to continue.
