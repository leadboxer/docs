# G Suite email tracking

We offer a gmail add-in to [track emails sent from gmail](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/119-email-tracking-with-gmail-in-leadboxer)

Prefer to use the G Suite version of our email tracking solution? Then install our [G Suite email tracking app](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/leadboxer/916928181495)

### How to install the Email tracking App for G Suite&#x20;

Choose between a domain install (for all users in your G Suite account) OR an Individual Install.

Before you can use the app, you will need to configure the dataset ID. &#x20;

To do so, select any email in your account to display the LeadBoxer panel contents

***

In Settings, add your dataset ID (you can find this in your datasets overview [here](https://app.leadboxer.com/datasets).) ![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/565e1cb7c697915b26a5c214/images/5d9c5dfc2c7d3a7e9ae23630/file-SqWfWT0BSX.png)

***

Close the panel (click the X)

Now lets start using the plugin, by composing an email and add some tracking:

Click the Compose window, draft your email and click the LeadBoxer icon

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/565e1cb7c697915b26a5c214/images/5d9c617a2c7d3a7e9ae23655/file-KBTF7tKlqh.png)

***

In this screen you need to provide a name/ subject/ campaign so we can identify the email recipient in LeadBoxer

You can also optionally add a link that we will track automatically

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/565e1cb7c697915b26a5c214/images/5d9c627204286364bc901d11/file-YiZATYVBCv.png)

Note: the LeadBoxer website tracking pixel needs to be installed on the domain where the links lead.

***

That's it, now send the email and all Recipient activity will start showing in your LeadBoer account

Happy tracking!
