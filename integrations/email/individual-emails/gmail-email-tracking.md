Click the LeadBoxer icon to **enable** (blue) or **disable** (grey) the extension

Continue composing your email and optionally add links to your website ( **recommended**)&#x20;

When you hit send, the extension will:

1. Add a tracking pixel to the email in order to track the email opens
2. Add additional parameters to the links already present in your email&#x20;

Once the recipient opens the mail and (optionally) clicks the link, it will appear in your LeadBoard like this:

Note: all subsequent pageviews once recipients land on your site are added to the same profile and customer journey.
