#### Step 4: Configure add-in

Once installed, make sure the add-in is setup correctly by going to the LeadBoxer Settings pane.&#x20;

In the Settings pane you should see a field for your dataset ID and the option to configure your link tracking.

The dataset ID field should automatically be populated with your dataset ID if you have setup a subscription in step 1 and 2.

**Configure Link tracking**&#x20;

> _Note: Outlook for Mac email client not supported at the moment_

In order for us to start tracking the links in your emails, you need to enable this feature and specify the domains you want us to track: ![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/565e1cb7c697915b26a5c214/images/60a3d46eeb3af44cc1209c4a/file-VqzZo0xPts.png)

***

#### Step 5: Tracking your emails

Compose an email as you would normally, and make sure you add a recipient and the email title (subject).\
Now, before you send the email, you need to activate the LeadBoxer tracking for each individual email by clicking the three dots icon and selecting the **Track this e-mail** option from the LeadBoxer menu item.

> [Note: The advanced Add-in version has the option to auto-enable tracking for each email. See details here.](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/172-advanced-outlook-add-in)

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/565e1cb7c697915b26a5c214/images/60a3cf11dca0fd46b93565e0/file-FTNFMWeval.png)

This will add the tracking pixel and append the links inside your emails with tracking parameters.

***

### Step 6: tracking details

Once the email is sent, you can see tracking details either from within Outlook, or log in to the LeadBoxer app and see all activity.
