### Get your Audiences from LeadBoxer

Selecting your audience is an important part of setting up your LinkedIn ad campaigns.&#x20;

There are many options to select your target audience and it can be quite overwhelming to find the correct settings.

Some time ago, LinkedIn introduced the option to [upload a list of companies or persons](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/73938) to target or to find lookalikes.

You can now use LeadBoxer to create these lists. See this tutorial / documentation for more details:

#### Notes about your landing pages

This is still the default way for most companies to get leads from online campaigns: You advertise or promote some content to get targeted traffic on a landing page that is geared towards visitors filling out a form. This is your Call-to-Action.&#x20;

This is relatively easy to set up and can work really well if you have a good working landing page that is optimized for conversion. &#x20;

IMPORTANT (to avoid disappointment): Paid LinkedIn traffic is relatively expensive so this page needs to be highly optimized so that valuable info (e.g. a white paper) is available after leaving an email address through a (tracked) form.&#x20;

The Call-to-Action needs to 1) be clear and 2) the page needs a proven conversion-rate. (eg test with less expensive traffic first).

The main risk is that leads land there, look around, and go away without filling out the form. Obviously we can often still identify the company, but that is usually not enough to get qualified as a real lead.&#x20;

If you do not have a proven landing page, we recommend the you go with method 3 or 4
