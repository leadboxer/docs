# What is Enrichment?

Here is an example of a question we frequently receive:

Q: I have an account with leadboxer, but I can't see the individual people's details like name of the person and email ID who are visiting on our website, is there any way to get that information?

A: Individual names and email addresses not available by default, because of how the internet is built. Collecting this information a part of the qualification process.&#x20;

A potential lead starts at 0 - before they visit your site, and their leadscore builds up the more you know about them. It is an iterative process.&#x20;

The process of gathering this information is called Enrichment. \
The basis, or default, information, is their visit, location, and what they have done (clicked) on your site. \
In numerous cases, we can also identify the Company - in which case we can provide company contact details. \
From here - we move to the next step which is any additional information that we can collect. \
Additional information is collected through Visitor Touchpoints.&#x20;

Examples of Visitor Touchpoints are:&#x20;

\- a login\
\- a sign-up\
\- a login/ sign-up using Social Media (for example LinkedIN, Twitter, Facebook, or Google+)\
\- a CONTACT form\
\- a Download\
\- a click on a link from an newsletter
