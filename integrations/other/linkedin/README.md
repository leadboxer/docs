## Get your Audiences from LeadBoxer

Selecting your audience is an important part of setting up your LinkedIn ad campaigns.&#x20;

There are many options to select your target audience and it can be quite overwhelming to find the correct settings.

Some time ago, LinkedIn introduced the option to [upload a list of companies or persons](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ad-targeting/matched-audiences) to target or to find lookalikes.

You can now use LeadBoxer to create these lists. See this tutorial / documentation for more details:

#### Notes about your landing pages

This is still the default way for most companies to get leads from online campaigns: You advertise or promote some content to get targeted traffic on a landing page that is geared towards visitors filling out a form. This is your Call-to-Action.&#x20;

This is relatively easy to set up and can work really well if you have a good working landing page that is optimized for conversion. &#x20;

IMPORTANT (to avoid disappointment): Paid LinkedIn traffic is relatively expensive so this page needs to be highly optimized so that valuable info (e.g. a white paper) is available after leaving an email address through a (tracked) form.&#x20;

The Call-to-Action needs to 1) be clear and 2) the page needs a proven conversion-rate. (eg test with less expensive traffic first).

The main risk is that leads land there, look around, and go away without filling out the form. Obviously we can often still identify the company, but that is usually not enough to get qualified as a real lead.&#x20;

If you do not have a proven landing page, we recommend the you go with method 3 or 4



## LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms

### Intro: What are LinkedIn Lead Gen Form

A [Lead Gen form](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/native-advertising/lead-gen-ads) is a simple form that is offered when a lead clicks your ad on LinkedIn.

The lead stays within the LinkedIn platform and the form is pre-populated with their LinkedIn details

The ideal situation to use a Lead Gen Form is when you can offer a white-paper or valuable info or a trial / consult, etc.

When your lead submits the form, you can redirect them to a Thank You page, which will create the user in LeadBoxer where we will try to identify the company based on the IP address. (make sure to use UTM tags to identify the campaign later)

But we are not done yet:

The actual lead (the individual) is now stored inside the LinkedIn platform, and this data cannot be passed along to a landing page.&#x20;

To work around that problem we suggest the following route:

Instead of sending them straight to a landing page where they can download the valuable info (eg whitepaper, etc), we use email to complete the transaction and get the actual lead identified on the site.

You start by using a tool to get the lead data from LinkedIn into your marketing automation or email platform (for example through Zapier to Mailchimp).&#x20;

In your email platform, you add these leads to a new list and a new campaign where you automatically send them a (tracked) email with a (tracked) link to a download page on your site. There they can actually download the whitepaper/ PDF.&#x20;

This may sound complicated or burdensome for the lead, but the benefit of this setup is that you are now in full control of the data, and also:&#x20;

* You have their (real) contact details
* You have the lead identified on your site and inside LeadBoxer.&#x20;
* When they return to the site later down the road, they will be automatically recognized by LeadBoxer and you can get notified when they become qualified.
* Last but not least, the lead will now be in your marketing automation platform and you can start nurturing them.

### Example implementation:&#x20;

### Whitepaper download using LinkedIn -> Mailchimp -> LeadBoxer

Preparation:

1. Create the White-paper&#x20;
2. On your website, create a new page where visitors can download the whitepaper.Make sure the page is not indexed by search engines and that no other pages are linking to this page.
3. In LeadBoxer, connect your Mailchimp account&#x20;
4. In Mailchimp, create a new list / audience and create an [automated email campaign](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-an-automation/) with a link to your download page. Make sure you tag the link as described in step 2 of the [LeadBoxer Mailchimp integration](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/15-mailchimp-email-tracking)

Create campaign

1. Create the ad content or /sponsored post.
2. Use a Lead Gen Form. A super easy tutorial can be viewed here: [https://youtu.be/SAAE4c5Efgg](https://youtu.be/SAAE4c5Efgg)

Bringing it all together

1. Use a connection tool like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/linkedin-lead-gen-forms/integrations/mailchimp) or [Automate.io](https://automate.io/integration/linkedin-lead-gen-forms/mailchimp) to get the Lead data from LinkedIn to automatically add them to the new Mailchimp audience list.&#x20;

Thats it, Done.

### So what will happen in a nutshell?

1. Leads fill in the form on LinkedIn
2. The automated Mailchimp campaign will send an email to the lead with a link to the download page.
3. Once they click the link, LeadBoxer connects to Mailchimp and fetches the lead details.
4. You can now use LeadBoxer to send notifications to your sales team when the lead becomes ready to buy.
