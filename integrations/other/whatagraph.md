# Whatagraph

Create rich dashboard visualisations of LeadBoxer data with Whatagraph

Note: you need access to the Whatagraph **Custom API Connection** feature in order to use our integration.

#### Getting Started.

1. Before you start, think about the data you want to visualize.  &#x20;
2. Create a segment and use the filters to narrow down the audience you want to graph out. For example everyone that downloaded a white-paper.
3.  Login to Whatagraph as Admin, go to your sources page and select Custom API source and click New account.
