For instance, you can create a channel in which all new leads are shown with the  corresponding information of your interest.

Depending on your previous decisions, you will see a set of options. Fill these in according to your preferences.

Simply test the Zap by clicking Create & Continue. Congratulations! You have a working Zap, all you have to do now is turn it on!

To avoid being spammed because you have so much traffic on your website, we can set up a filter. The filter can be found at the 'plus' between Leadboxer end Slack, as shown on the image below.

This way you can filter out messages for companies with an unsufficient leadscore, no company name, no e-mail or any set up you like. The set up below will filter out all leads with a Lead Score that you think is not worthy of chasing.
