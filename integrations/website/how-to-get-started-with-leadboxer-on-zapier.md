Next you will have to select the dateset (website) you wish to connect for this Zap and continue.

If you use Leadboxer for different datasets and wish to connect each of them to another tool, you will have to create a new zap for each dataset. It might be convenient to attach the datasets name as a tag to the lead in your tool to keep track of where your leads come from, this can be done in a later stadium of setting up your zap.&#x20;

(Optional)  You can specify what leads need to be forwarded to your tool.  Here you can filter the leads for whatever criteria you wish. For example, if you only want leads with a leadscore of 20 or higher to be loaded into the selected tool.
