# How to Install the LeadBoxer Tracking Pixel

#### Introduction

By installing the LeadBoxer Tracking Pixel on your website(s), we will automatically start to collect data and provide more information about your website visitors.

The LeadBoxer Tracking Pixel is a small snippet of javascript that will track all **users** (visitors), **sessions** (visits) and **events** (pageviews) for all the pages you install it on.

Once the Pixel is in place, we immediately start tracking and identifying your leads and customers. &#x20;

#### Installation

If you havent done so already, the first step is to [Start a trial](https://www.leadboxer.com/start/) at leadboxer.com - you will then receive the Pixel (code snippet) from us.

You can use any of the following plugins / tutorials to get started:\


* [Wordpress](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/17-wordpress-leadboxer-plug-in)
* [Drupal](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/85-drupal-module)
* [Google Tag Manger](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/76-using-google-tag-manager-to-insert-lead-pixel)
* [Unbounce](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/121-track-unbounce-landing-pages)

**Other / Manual installation**

If you do not use any of above solutions, simply paste your Lead Pixel into the source code of your website just before the end \</body> tag. The best place is the footer or template - this will place the tracking code in the whole site, and usually takes less than 5 minutes.

#### Where to find your tracking Pixel or dataset ID

The tracking pixel and/or dataset ID can be found here:

#### Adding extra sites (datasets)

You can add extra datasets to your LeadBoxer account.
