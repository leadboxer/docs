# Lead Pixel

**Definition Lead Pixel**: a code snippet you get from LeadBoxer and place in one or more pages in your website. Any visitor to that page activates the pixel and is then captured as a potential lead. The Lead Pixel functions to a) identify the company behind the visit and b) record all future visits by that lead.

**How it works**: Drop the Lead Pixel (JavaScript code snippet) in your site. Once in place, the pixel generates a list of leads - names of companies interested in your products and services, based on your website traffic.

**Where to put it**: Track incoming leads across your whole website. You can also put the pixel into individual landing pages. Examples would be a contact form or newsletter sign-up form. You can  [integrate the pixel directly](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/16-getting-started), use  [our WordPress plugin](https://docs.leadboxer.com/article/17-wordpress-leadboxer-plug-in), or get an API license.&#x20;

**What you can accomplish with a Lead Pixel**:\
1\. Generate a list of qualified leads - companies interested in your product/service - based on their interest in your site.\
2\. Prioritise leads based on leadscore - automatically sort through all incoming leads using big data algorithms to score based on quality\
3\. Track all activity on your site by (potential) leads - during sales cycles and beyond
