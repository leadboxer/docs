# Pipedrive Workflow Automation with LeadBoxer

Pipedrive harnesses a powerful rule-based automation feature called **Automation**.

Automation can take a trigger event and perform one or many actions if the trigger is fired. The nice thing about this is that it can trigger based on the content of a note inside an activity, which is exactly what LeadBoxer creates. Meaning that you can automate your workflow based on the web and email behaviour of your Leads & Customers!

The possibilities are endless, but go get you going we are going to prove an example. In this example we are going to fire a slack message if a lead or customer looks at the pricing page.
