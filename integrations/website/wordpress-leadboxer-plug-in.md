### Installation

To install the plugin, either:

* Add the plug-in via your WordPress admin plugin section
* Upload the .zip file using the plugin installer
* SFTP the files over to your wp-content/plugins/ directory
* And activate it after successful installation.

### Configuration

To make the plugin work correctly, you need to enter your dataset ID that you received when you singed up for a (trial) account. Only enter your actual dataset number. Do not enter the words "dataset=" when you cut & paste.

You can set this setting under Settings -> LeadBoxer

You will need to enter your dataset ID as you registered it with LeadBoxer.\
NOTE: just enter your dataset number do not enter "dataset="\
So, for example, this is incorrect: "dataset=cd5717170a36ce6b02baf64c6deaf8c6"\
Correct: "cd5717170a36ce6b02baf64c6deaf8c6"
