# Lead Management Workflow

### How will I benefit?

Configuring your workflow will unlock the full potential of LeadBoxer. In real terms: we will measure key engagement milestones and organise your leads so that they are visualised (segmented) according to where they are in respective buyer stages. You can of course use the LeadBoxer without this extra configuration, but this will make it fly.

The main benefit is that you actually can see for each lead what stage they are in. \
This should determine how you interact and how you communicate with each lead. It may also determine who, in your company, will communicate with them; Marketing, Pre-sales, Customer Succes or Sales.

### What LeadBoxer features are involved?

The place to create your qualification workflow and manage your leads is called the [LeadBoard](fundamentals/tasks.md).&#x20;

The tool to automate the steps from your qualification workflow is called [Workflow Automation](fundamentals/elements/workflow-automation.md).\


### Quick Summary&#x20;

A B2B buyer's journey is made up of multiple buying phases or stages. Workflow automation enables you to map the stages to specific behavior (actions). You can then easily filter and segment both audience and users into their respective stages.

Think of this process as mapping the ideal sales flow.&#x20;

There are 2 parts to the process of setting up and configuring your LeadBoard:

#### Step 1: define lead stages & key events

1. Define the stage(s) your prospects and leads need to complete in order to become real opportunities (see complete explanation below). Typically 3-4.
2. Create a list of key events that are measured and categorize them to each stage (see  explanation below).

#### Step 2: setup stages in LeadBoxer:

1. Make a new LeadBoard and add the stages from Step 1 above
2. In your Workflow Automation:&#x20;
   1. Add a tag with the name of the stage to each of the key events from Step 2,&#x20;
   2. Add rules to move cards between stages (based on lead tags)



## Preparing your workflow

### 1. Define your lead stages&#x20;

In most cases, a complete buyer journey can be defined using these 7 stages:

1. **Awareness** : The buyer becomes aware that they have a problem. eg: searches in Google.
2. **Orientation :** The buyer starts looking around to orientate. eg reads blog posts, watch videos
3. **Discovery** : The buyer is checking out various solutions to their problem. Be in this list.
4. **Interest** : The buyer is interested in a few solutions, wants to know more, test it, see it.
5. **Evaluation** : the buyer has tested it, and is now evaluating and comparing solutions.
6. **Intent** : The buyer has intent to buy an solution shortly, wants to negotiate price or contract.
7. **Decision** : The buyer has decided on the best solution to their problem. becomes a customer.

However, at LeadBoxer we rather focus on the middle part of this journey: the stages where behaviour can be measured and categorised.&#x20;

This means we recommend you focus on these stages: **Orientation, Discovery, Interest, Intent, Decision**

### **Example event mapping**

Here are some example events that can be mapped to a buyer journey stage

<table><thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>Example events</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Orientation</strong></td><td><ul><li>Blog post read</li><li>Podcast listend</li><li>Landing page viewed</li></ul></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Discovery</strong></td><td><ul><li>Product pages viewed</li><li>Pricing page viewed</li><li>Features pages</li><li>Case study download</li></ul></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Interest</strong></td><td><ul><li>Started a Trial</li><li>Booked a Demo call</li><li>Joined a Webinar</li></ul></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intent</strong></td><td><ul><li>Looked at Contact page</li><li>Signed up for Newsletter or Course</li><li>scheduled On-boarding call</li></ul></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Decision</strong></td><td><ul><li>Did a checkout</li><li>Requested an invoice</li></ul></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>



Obviously you can design and customize your workflow to your needs. Additional example stages are: Exploration, Nurturing, On-boarding, Negotiation, etc.

The last stage is usually a Sales Qualified Lead (SQL).&#x20;



### 2. List the actions or key events&#x20;

Make a list of the events (pageviews, clicks, sign-ups, opening newsletter, etc) that characterize each stage of the customer journey. In other words, in order to score behavior and tag events, we need a list of key actions (events).&#x20;

Examples of key events are: viewed a specific product page, viewed pricing page, downloaded a PDF white paper, Form submits, sign-ups, opened or clicked through from a newsletter or email, etc. We can measure anything and everything that takes place digitally.\


## Implementing your workflow

### 1. Create a new LeadBoard and add the stages

Go to the [LeadBoard](fundamentals/tasks.md) section of our account, and [create a new LeadBoard](guides/creating-your-first-leadboard.md). Use the stages from preparation Step 1 to define the columns. No worries, you can always edit and modify these later.

### 2. Map key events with tags

Using [Workflow Automation](fundamentals/elements/workflow-automation.md) triggers and Actions, add a [Lead Tag](fundamentals/elements/lead-tags.md) with the name of the stage for each of the key events from Step 2.

These tags are used to segment and move your leads into different columns on your LeadBoard. Events should be mapped to specific stages. For example, if a lead views a brochure they are tagged with ‘Orientation’.&#x20;

## Final results

Once you have gone through all above steps, you will have a fully automated Lead Qualification process in place in the form of a LeadBoard automatically filled with Leads from your target audience. You can see your leads move to their current stage based on their behaviour.
