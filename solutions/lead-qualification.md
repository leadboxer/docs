# Lead Qualification

## How to qualify a lead

### A definition of Lead Qualification.

In our last post we introduced Lead Hacking.\
We outlined Step One:  [Lead identification](https://www.leadboxer.com/blog/lead-hacking-definition/).

In this post we will discuss:

* What is lead qualification
* Example qualification criteria
* Sample leadscore metrics

Once you’ve read this, you should be able to define your own lead qualification criteria.

In this post, we dive into lead hacking with a short look into Lead Qualification.

> _**In plain language: qualifying a lead means taking steps (gathering information) in order to decide when to contact a lead.**_

There is a system at work in terms of deciding when a lead moves, for example, from receiving automated marketing, to receiving a phone call or personal email.

Once you have identified the lead (via company, interest expressed, contact form submitted, etc), the next step is to qualify the lead for the next step in your workflow.

There are a number of ways to qualify a lead. This depends on factors such as your target market, workflow, and the nature of your product. Unless you have a very low number of leads, you’ll want to automate this in some way, by establishing your qualification criteria.

Here are some potential qualification factors:

1. Has your product been tested/installed?
2. Is the lead a “real” company, ie do they have a budget
3. Are they in the correct industry or sector
4. How many employees does your lead have
5. Are they located in the correct region
6. Is there sufficient contact info to start talking – email, phone, website, company name
7. Has a contact person been identified
8. Has engagement with your product or service been measured (logins, clicks, installs, etc)
9. Freshness, how recently have they engaged

Start by deciding the three pieces of information that you like to know about a potential lead. These criteria should tell you if it’s worthwhile to contact this lead. That is qualification in a nutshell.

What to talk about (engagement) will be covered in our next post.

**Conclusion: the point is to get a total picture of what you know about a lead, and use your understanding to decide whether or not to pursue the lead.**

### First-party Intent Data

If your marketing or sales team isn’t leveraging first-party intent data when qualifying prospects, then you can assume there’s a huge leak in your workflow or pipeline. When it comes to identifying accounts with the highest likelihood of doing business with your company, first-party intent data at your disposal.



### Lead scoring & Segmentation

Lead scoring is a methodology used to rank prospects against a scale that represents the perceived value of each lead. The resulting score is used to qualify and determine which leads are ready to pass to sales. At LeadBoxer we give each lead an automatically calculated, but personal Leadscore.&#x20;

Applying Filters on your leads allows you to slice and dice the data so that only pre-qualified leads show up in your lists.



### Lead Profile Enrichment

All Identified Leads are automatically matched to various company database sources and enriched with their firmographic data such as industry, location, size, domain, social profiles, and many more data points.

**Bring your own data**

You can add and enrich all profiles with your own data by using our integrations, connectors or API. Our team of data specialists can also build any integration for you if you do not have the resources available.
